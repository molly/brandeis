brandeis - humourously named script for parsing U.S. Supreme Court cases from plain text to wikitext

Have you ever thought, "Gee, I wish I had the full text of every decision ever
made by the United States Supreme Court" IN WIKITEXT? No? I'm the only one?

This program is a follow up to Mark Holmquist's [lochner](http://gitorious.org/lochner) script. 
Eventually, we hope to make this into a fancy little Wikisource bot!
