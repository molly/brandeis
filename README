lochner - humourously named script for fetching U.S. Supreme Court cases

Have you ever thought, "Gee, I wish I had the full text of every decision ever
made by the United States Supreme Court"? No? I'm the only one?

Well, in any case, this script is a simple way to fetch a big bunch of
documents from a website with a simple predefined hierarchy, documents that
are formatted in HTML, but that will be output in plaintext.

This project is simple enough to start using. Simply do

  $ git clone https://git.gitorious.org/lochner/lochner.git
  $ cd lochner
  $ npm install
  $ node lochner

This will start pulling every single court case available on Justia, so be
prepared for some minor HTTP traffic and a little bit of disk use.

The output directory is currently hardcoded, as is the source and the output
format. These are all TODO items, sadly.

Future:
* Output in more complete wikitext format
* Output in other formats, like HTML (would maybe not need to convert
  anything)
* Test suite, maybe
* Database for keeping track of what cases we already have - versioned so we
  can re-fetch documents that were picked up with an old formatting engine
